CCS FACULTY CONSULTATION HOURS SYSTEM


G-CAS (Gordon College Appointment System)


Brief description
A system that records and displays the time availability of CCS faculty members for student consultations in real time. 

Problem Statement
Consultation between students and instructors is important. However, even when instructors announce their consultation hours, their actual availability may not always align with the given schedule. This often results in students waiting for long periods of time, uncertain whether the instructor is available or not. As a result, students may waste time and effort to go to the campus and attempt to meet instructors who are unavailable, making the consultation process inefficient and inconvenient.

Goals
To improve the current faculty consultation process.
To provide students and faculty members with a convenient and reliable system.
To reduce time wasted due to uncertainty in faculty availability. 

Target Users 
End Users:
CCS Students
Can view faculty consultation availability
CCS Faculty Members
Set and Update consultation hours
Sponsors:
CCS Department - owns the consultation process

Preliminary Risks
Limited Adoption by Faculty - Some faculty members may not consistently update their availability.
Technical limitations - limited development experience may affect system stability.
Time constraints - short development period may limit feature completeness and testing.
In-Scope 
User Authentication using Gordon College domain accounts.
Role-based access (faculty and student).
CRUD operations for consultation schedules and availability.
Basic, user-friendly interface for viewing and updating consultation hours.

Out-of-Scope
Automated notifications (email, push notifications)
Integration with external calendar systems (e.g. Google Calendar)
Mobile Application

High-level features (3-6 core functions)

User authentication using Gordon College domain account.
CRUD operations for managing consultation schedules and availability.
Real-time updates of faculty availability status.

Key constraints (time, technology, resources, budget)
Time constraints. Limited development time that may result in a system with minimal
 features.
Technology constraints. Average level of experience in system development.
Budget constraints. The system must be developed with little to no financial cost.

Assumptions
The system will be easy to understand and use by both students and faculty members.
The system will be more efficient than the current manual consultation process.

Vision Statement
Create a consultation management system that helps CCS students and faculty members reduce uncertainty by providing real-time and centralized access to faculty consultation hours.
